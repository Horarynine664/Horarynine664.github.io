	<p> HoraryNine664 Afked for about 1 hour, but to his dismay, found that his creeper farm had produced minimal gunpowder. </p>
	<p> and that the type of farm he made only worked in the java edition of minecraft. :_( . </p>
	<p> I destroyed my creeper farm and then realized that the building that Bananabirdboy made right next to the location. </p>
